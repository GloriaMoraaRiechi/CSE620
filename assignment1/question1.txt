1. Make a code that takes any list of numbers and calculates and displays the mean, median, standard deviation, variance, range and interquartile range. (Pesudocode, without using predefined funtions)

START

  Print "Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces"    //Gives instructions to the user on how the numbers should appear
  Input list                                             //Allows the user to enter a list of numbers
 
  Initialize count to zero                               //Count is set to zero and will be used to keep track of the number of elements in the list
  initialize index to zero                               //Index is set to zero and will be used to iterate through the list
  Initialize maxNumber to list[0]                        //The maximum number in the list is first initialized to the first element in the list
  Initialize minNumber to list[0]                        //The minimum number in the list is first initialized to the first element in the list

  While list[index] exists                               //Loops through the list to check if index exists, if it exists, it updates the value of count and 
                                                         //index by incrementing each by one
  	count = count + 1
	index = index + 1
  Sort list in ascending order 

  //CALCULATING THE MEAN
  Initialize sum to zero
  for each number in list:
  	sum = sum + number
  mean = sum / count
  Print "The mean of the numbers in the list is", mean  

  //FINDING THE MEDIAN
  If count is odd
	median is the middle element
  Else
	median is the average of the two middle elements
  Print "The median of the numbers in the list is", median   


  //CALCULATING THE VARIANCE: obtained by finding the deviation of each number from the mean, adding all the deviations and 
  //then finding the square of the total of the deviations which is divided by the total number of elements in the list

  Initialize sumV to zero                                   //Initializes the sum of the deviations to zero
  For each number in list: 
	sumV = sumV + (number-mean)^2                       //Updates the value of the total that will be used to calculate the variance
  variance = sumV/count
  Print "The variance of the numbers in the list is:", variance
  

  //CALCULATING THE STANDARD DEVIATION (This is the square root of the variance obtained above)
  std = variance^0.5
  Print "The standard deviation of the numbers in the list is:", std


  //FINDING THE RANGE
  //Iterate through the list to find the maximum and minimum numbers in the list
  Initialize index to 1                                //Starts from the second element in the list
  If list[] > maxNumber                                //Checks if the current number is greater than the previous element which we initlized to be the
                                                       //the first element in the list
	set maxNumber to list[index]                   //Updates the maxNumber if the condition is met
  If list[index] < minNumber                           //Checks if the current number is less than the previous element which we initally set to be the
                                                       //the first element in the list
	set nimNumber to list[index]                   //Updates the minNumber if the condition is met
  index = index + 1
  
  range = maxNumber - minNumber
  Print "The range of the mumbers in the list is", range


  //CALCULATE INTERQUARTILE RANGE
  Initialize Q1Index to (count+1)*0.25                //Calculates the index for the 25th percentile
  Initialize Q1 to the element at the Q1Index
  
  Initialize Q3Index to (count+1)1*0.75               //Calculates the index for the 75th percentile
  Initalize Q3 to the element at the Q3Index

  interquartileRange = Q3-Q1
  Print "The interquartile range is:, interquartileRange
