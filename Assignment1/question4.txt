4. Write a function using pseudocode that computes the list of the first
   100 fibonacci numbers.

START
 //Create a function that returns a list of the first 100 fibonacci numbers 
 function cumputeFibonacci()
 	//initialize an empty list that stores the first fibonacci numbers
	fibList = []
  	
	//add 0 and 1 the first and second numbers to the list
        firstNumber = 0
	secondNumber = 0
  	append firstNumber to fibList
	append secondNumber to fiblist

	//iterates from 3 to 100, generating the next 98 fibonacci numbers
	for number = 3 to 100
		nextNumber = firstNumber + secondNumber
		append nextnumber to fibList
  		
	//update firstNumber and secondNumber to the most recent numbers
	firstNumber = secondNumber
	secondNumber = nextNumber
        
	end for
	
	print fibList
  end function
  
  //call the function
  computeFibonacci()
