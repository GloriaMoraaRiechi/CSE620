2. Create a code using pseudocode that randomly generates passwords of
   alternating letters and numbers of a user defined length

START
 //prompt the user to enter his/her desired length of the password
 print "Enter the desired length of the password, should be greater than 4"       
						       
 //get input and store the desired length in the variable length
 input length
 
 //define a function that takes length as an argument
 function passwordGenerator(length)
 
 //Check if the length is greater than zero
 if length < 5
 	print "The length of the password should be greater than 5"
	return ""      //exists the function, returns an empty string
		       //the pocess stops since the fucntion cannot 
 		       //generate a valid password if condition is not met
 endif

 //initialize password, an empty string variable that will store the generated password
 set password = ""

 //initialize the letters and numbers that will be used in generating the password
 numbers = "0123456789"
 letters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
 letterslength = 52
 numbersLength = 0
 
 //initialize the indexes of the varibles letters and numbers that will be used to track
 //the position of the letters and numbers being added to the password
 indexL = 1
 indexN = 1

 //use a for loop that will continue generating the password as long as the length is 
 //greater than 4 upto the desired length with which it will terminate
 while length > 4
    set index to random number between 0 and 51  //any index of the 52 letters is selected
    add letters[index] to password               //character at selected index added to password
    length = length - 1                          //decrease the length by one as one character has
                                              	 //been added to the password
 
    if length > 4 
      set index to a random number between 0 and 9  //any index of the 10 numbers is selected
      add numbers[index] to password                //number at selected index added to password
      length = length - 1                           
    endif 
 endwhile

 return password
 
 end function
